# CORE VERTICAL — Education & Learning Systems

This repository defines the Education vertical for CORE.

It is a **safe, explainable physics platform**
for learning and exploration.

## Physics Stack

All engines may be used, but:
- outputs are simplified
- safety filters are applied
- complexity is gated

## What This Vertical Is

- A **learning environment**
- A **visual exploration system**
- A **guided experimentation platform**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not assessment software
- Not surveillance
- Not unrestricted experimentation

## Registries & Lenses

- Curriculum-aligned presets
- Visualization profiles
- Safe experiment templates

## Governance

Safety, accessibility, and clarity override depth.
